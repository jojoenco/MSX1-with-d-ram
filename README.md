# MSX1-with-d-ram
MSX1 compatible machine with old fashion D-Ram

Tested until vesion 2.5 
This is version 2.6 should work as I only removed the Opamp for audio out and chanced the Transistor for the (Cassete)relay that
probably nobody uses. (because there is also a jack in and out for the cassete)

What works and tested in vesion 2.5:
- [x] Boot with MSX-Bios and C-Bios 
- [x] Video Out
- [x] audio out (sound was bad in version 2.5 so removed Opamp in 2.6)
- [x] Joystick ports
- [x] cassete in through 3.5"mm jack
- [ ] cassete out not tested
- [ ] Cassete DIN not tested
- [ ] relay did not switch in version 2.5 (chanced transistor but not tested yet)
- [x] reset
- [X] Keyboard 
- [X] Cartridge Slot 1 and Slot2
- [ ] Printer port not tested
